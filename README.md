The business of mountain hut is observed to have a few specific characteristics.
- A group of limited users, to be specific, mountain hikers.
- The huts, located on mountains, may not have access to the internet, some probably can't receive wireless signals.
- During the winter season, many huts are closed as the weather conditions keep the hikers off.

Data persistence
Database appears to be the primary choice, but the running cost of holding a database
with only a bunch of reservations is high.
In many cases, the owners manage the reservation info locally. If the app can provide a way to
display the info within an acceptable timeframe, it will be a help for both the owners and users.
First, how to get the local data to the app?
If the app provides an upload function, it is good but privilege management becomes necessary, additional cost.
Using a flat file or Excel file seems to be a reasonable option, if concurrence access can be gracefully addressed. (Need to find more about this.)

The web app is close to a static website.
It is very helpful because the running cost can be significantly lower and the app doesn't get
crashed easily.
Moreover, if the app works well with mobile devices, it is also a pleasant thing.

What about open source UI libraries?
One option is to build UI components from scratch with plain technologies. It appears attractive
because all the source codes can be seen. However, considering the time and effort saved by
using it, an open source library is more preferrable, especially a widely used one, as it has been 
intensively tested in production by its users.
Chakara UI is one of these libraries. It's easy to use as well as intuitive in terms of style setting.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
